**ClimaWise:** "Stock up on essentials, secure your home, and have an evacuation plan ready. Monitor official weather updates closely."

**User:** "How do cyclones form?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Cyclones form over warm ocean waters when atmospheric conditions align. They need sea temperatures above 26°C and low wind shear to develop."

**User:** "What's the wind speed of a category 3?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Category 3 cyclones have sustained winds of 178-208 km/h. These are considered major cyclones and can cause significant damage."

### Example Session 2: Ocean Health

**User:** "How is the coral reef near Mauritius?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Some areas are stressed due to bleaching, but marine parks are helping protect them."

**User:** "What causes bleaching?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Bleaching happens when corals get stressed by high water temperatures or pollution. They expel the algae that gives them color and nutrients."

**User:** "How can I help?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Use reef-safe sunscreen, avoid touching corals, and practice sustainable fishing. Reducing pollution and runoff also helps protect reefs."

**User:** "What about water quality?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Water quality affects reef health through temperature, pH levels, and pollution. Check ClimaGuard's Ocean Health dashboard for real-time metrics."

### Example Session 3: Flood Safety

**User:** "What should I do if a flood occurs?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Move to higher ground immediately and follow local emergency instructions."

**User: "How can I prepare beforehand?"

### Example Session 4: Mixed Topics

**User:** "Tell me about cyclone formation"  
**ClimaWise:** "Cyclones form over warm ocean waters when atmospheric conditions align. They need sea temperatures above 26°C and low wind shear to develop."

**ClimaWise:** "Ocean pollution includes plastic waste, oil spills, and chemical contamination. Check ClimaGuard's pollution detection feature for real-time monitoring."

**User:** "Is it getting worse?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Pollution levels vary by location. Marine protected areas show improvement, but some regions still face challenges. Check the Ocean Health dashboard for current data."

**User:** "How does pollution affect cyclones?"  
**ClimaWise:** "Pollution doesn't directly cause cyclones, but it can affect ocean temperatures. Warmer waters from climate change can make cyclones more intense."
